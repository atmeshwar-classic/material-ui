# Material UI Assessment

## Getting Started
There is assessment is purely Design based. There is no functionality in this app. Therefore, you don't need any state management library. Use only Material UI.

You need to do the following:
- Create a theme and add custom colors as specified in the designs.
- Use MUI v5 and Emotion to create the styles and the components.
- The app need not have JS functionality.

## Follow the Figma Designs
You can find the designs [here](https://www.figma.com/file/uLWqtXUhy7iDllK3eo4Nww/MUI?node-id=0-1&t=wagJdhivbxs3OM4v-0)

## Assessment Review
Create a PR against main branch from your branch. Nomenclature for branches - name-empID, for eg: atmeshwar-1053
